web music player

#Ps. You need to click on the (main) thingy up next to the name of the repository and choose (web_music_player)

# Instructions on using this website:
• You need XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/) </br>
• And it's recommended to install it on the C drive </br>
• Once installed you need to launch it and enable MySQL and Apache </br>
• After that copy the folder that you downloaded and paste it in the folder called (htdocs) in the (xampp) folder </br>
• If you downloaded the files instead then just create a new folder in (htdocs) and paste your files in said foder </br>
• Then open your browser of choice then type (http://localhost/web_music_player/) </br>
• Or (http://localhost/{THE NAME OF THE FOLDER YOU CREATED}/)  -  the sentence between the "{}" is the name of the foledr you created

# Then the website should work fine :)
